# Usage

Upon clicking the start button, the timer starts (although incorrectly) and the question is displayed with the corresponding answers. Once it is debugged and the code starts working, the timer will subtract time from each incorrect answer and the correct answer will show, a next button will bring a user to the next question and answer list, and a score will track the correct answers. At the end, there will be a place to type your initials so that your high score can be tracked using web APIs.
